# Node Beginner tutorial

## Intro
1. What is node?
* A wrapper around VM like V8 with built-in modules providing rich features through easy-to-use asynchronous APIs
* VM: Virtual Machine
* API: Application Programming Interface
* An API isn’t the same as the remote server — rather it is the part of the server that receives requests and sends responses.

2. Why Node?
* Built-in modules (fs, http, crypto, zip, ...)
* Asynchronouse API (no threads)
* C++ addons
* Debugger and other utilities
* NPM
* Module dependency manager (referred to as CommonJS)
* One language through the whole stack

3. Some Analogies about Node
1. Node is like a baking recipe where the installs are the ingredients / tools
```
// THe making of a cupcake
// First steps:

$ npm install cake-mix
$ npm install cupcake-pan
```

2. Callbacks are like ordering coffee from Starbucks. You initiate the exchange and wait until the drink is ready to get the payload (latte). This is an example of Asynchronous Programming.

## Getting started with Node
1. REPL
* Read-Eval-Print-Loop
* In terminal or environment that reads your code, evaluates it, prints, and then waits for your response. Similar to sql environment in terminal.
* `.help` lists commands in REPL environment
* can run files via `node [filepath]`
* Timers: setTimeout || setInterval
